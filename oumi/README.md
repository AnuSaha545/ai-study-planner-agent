## Oumi Integration

Oumi is used to evaluate the quality of AI-generated study plans produced
by the AI Study Planner Agent.

The evaluation focuses on:
- Relevance of the plan to user inputs
- Coherence of the weekly schedule
- Completeness of subject coverage

This ensures responsible AI development by measuring output quality
without retraining models.
